Description: Studying genetic associations with prognosis (e.g. survival, disability, subsequent disease events) is
    problematic due to selection bias - also termed index event bias or collider bias - whereby selection on disease
    status can induce associations between causes of incidence with prognosis. The Slope-Hunter approach adjusts 
    genetic associations for this bias assuming that the contribution of the set of genetic variants affecting incidence
    only to the heritability of incidence is at least as large as the contribution of those affecting both incidence and prognosis.
